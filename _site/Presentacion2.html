# Base de datos

Una base de datos es un conjunto de datos pertenecientes a un mismo contexto y almacenados sistemáticamente para su posterior uso.
&lt;br/&gt;
Wikipedia

Una base de datos en estadística es un conjunto de información relacionada con una población organizada en filas y columnas. Las columnas corresponden a las variables y las filas están relacionadas con los individuos u objetos de estudio.


Existen repositorio de bases de datos para uso general

## Importar datos de manera automatica

La API de datos abiertos de Socrata le permite acceder mediante programación a una gran cantidad de recursos de datos abiertos de gobiernos, organizaciones sin fines de lucro y ONG de todo el mundo. Haga clic en el enlace de abajo y pruebe un ejemplo en vivo ahora mismo.

Cargar la base de datos de COVID-19 Colombia


```r
# install.packages("RSocrata")  # instal paquete RSocrata
 library(RSocrata)

 Colombia= read.socrata("https://www.datos.gov.co/resource/gt2j-8ykr.json", app_token = token)
 saveRDS(Colombia,"Colombia.RDS")
```

## Ordenar los datos

Es importante después de haber importado la base de datos, hacer una revisión de cada una de las variables con el fin de poder detectar:

+ Datos faltantes (NA)

+ Datos anómalos o raros


+ Etiquetas mal colocadas ( minúsculas, MAYÚSCULAS, Titulo...)

```r
&gt; table(Colombia$ubicacion)

        casa         Casa         CASA    Fallecido     Hospital Hospital UCI          N/A
